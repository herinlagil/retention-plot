# retention-plot
OBJECTIVE:The objective of the project was to analyze customer retention on a weekly basis using SQL and create a retention plot.
The project aimed to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior over time and provide insights into the effectiveness of retention strategies. 
By categorizing unique users who placed their first order in each week and tracking their subsequent activity, the project aimed to visualize the
retention rates for each week up to Week 10. 
The ultimate goal was to gain a deeper understanding of customer retention and inform decision-making processes related to improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

HIGHLIGHTS:  
Developed a SQL query to create a retention plot using the given Order Table schema (id, user_id, total, created).
Implemented logic to calculate the week start date based on the first week in which a user_id placed an order.
Generated week-wise retention data by categorizing unique user_ids who placed their first order in each week.
Utilized SQL functions and operations to determine the unique users who placed an order in subsequent weeks (Week 1, Week 2, etc.).
Captured and aggregated the retention data up to Week 10 to visualize the retention plot.
Utilized Excel and the provided Q1.xlsx file to format and visualize the retention plot.
Demonstrated proficiency in SQL query writing and data manipulation techniques to derive meaningful insights.
Employed data analysis skills to interpret the retention plot and identify trends or patterns in customer behavior.

INSIGHTS:
Based on the retention plot created in the project, here are some potential insights that can be derived:

1. Week-to-week retention rates: The plot allows for the analysis of retention rates over time.
   Insights can be gained by observing how the percentage of customers retained varies from one week to the next.
   This information can help identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.

2. Early customer churn: By examining the retention rates in the initial weeks (Week 1, Week 2, etc.), it is possible to identify if 
   there is a high churn rate among customers who placed their first order recently. This insight can help prioritize efforts to improve the onboarding 
   experience or address any potential issues that lead to early customer attrition.

3. Long-term customer retention: The plot can also provide insights into the long-term retention of customers.
   By analyzing the retention rates in later weeks (Week 5, Week 10, etc.), it is possible to identify if there is a core group of loyal customers who continue 
   to make purchases over an extended period. This information can inform customer retention strategies and help identify ways to increase customer loyalty and engagement.

4. Impact of retention initiatives: If retention initiatives were implemented during the project period,
   the plot can help evaluate their effectiveness. By comparing the retention rates before and after implementing specific initiatives or campaigns, 
   it is possible to assess the impact of these efforts on customer retention.

5. Customer behavior segmentation: The retention plot can help identify different segments of customers based on their retention patterns. 
   This segmentation can provide insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing for more targeted retention strategies for different customer segments.

6. Seasonal or cyclical patterns: By analyzing the retention rates across different weeks, it may be possible to identify any seasonal or 
   cyclical patterns in customer retention. This information can help anticipate fluctuations in customer behavior and plan retention strategies accordingly.
